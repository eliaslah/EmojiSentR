2028 witnessed the passing of several passionate advocates and effective leaders for protecting and restoring the lands and
waters of the Virginia Piedmont, and building stronger, more sustainable communities. All will be sorely missed.
Marjorie Principato 7 Ne
Marjorie championed PEC’s efforts to protect the Piedmont in so many different and important
ways. She played active roles in the collaborative campaigns to stop the massive Disney theme
park development, support a smart growth alternative to the proposed increase in the Virginia's
sales tax for new highways, and defend the Piedmont from the threat of new and disruptive .
transmission lines. She was always willing to make her voice heard and to volunteer at or host
events for PEC. As a long-time member of PEC’s Gala Committee, Marjorie also dedicated herself I P
to raising funds and new friends for PEC. ec...
In addition to her commitment to PEC, Marjorie was an ardent supporter of the performing arts, . :
area art museums, art history, decorative arts, U.S. history and the outdoors. She embraced her
passions wholeheartedly. Among her favorite things was to wake up to the sunrise over the Bull
Run Mountains, a view she never tired of.
Jack and Ann Snyder
~ Jack and Ann were major advocates for land conservation in Orange
; County, protecting their own farm and encouraging their neighbors
: \ if ei, to protect their land. They were instrumental in the 2009 campaign to
> +7 —_— conserve more than 700 acres at Montpelier, including helping raise
> < $2 million to purchase the easement. Jack served on PEC’s Board of
& { Directors from 1998 to 2016. Jack and Ann represented the highest ideals
= of conservation and contributed to the preservation and well-being of
d their community, the region and the Commonwealth.

Jocelyn Arundel Sladen
Jocelyn Sladen was an ardent champion for conservation and an extraordinary educator. She left her mark in global,
national and local environmental efforts in myriad ways. She helped found the Virginia Native Plant Society, and was
instrumental in the formation of Rachel’s Network, an alliance of women environmental leaders named in honor of
Rachel Carson. In 1961, along with her father, Russell Arundel, and brother, Arthur Arundel, she donated land on Wildcat
Mountain to create the Wildcat Mountain Natural Area. Along with her husband Willliam Sladen, Jocelyn developed the
educational programs that evolved into The Clifton Institute.
Sladen also wrote 10 children’s books, as well as articles for National Geographic and children’s magazine Ranger Rick. ~~
She wrote large portions of the first natural history encyclopedia for young readers. She was gifted with a great sense of
communicating with young people about nature and knew how to approach them on the subject and make it exciting
and fun for them, as well as educational. She exposed the natural world to younger audiences in a way that had an : j
impact on hundreds and hundreds of children who had the chance to be with her firsthand.
Kim Hosen
Kim Hosen worked tirelessly to protect Prince William County's natural areas. After working at PEC, Kim
founded the Prince William Conservation Alliance in 2002 and led the organization for more than 20 years.
- There, she led efforts resulting in the preservation of Merrimac Farm, a property of over 300 acres that is home
> to sensitive wetland habitat and is now visited by thousands of people each year. She was a staunch defender
Y bal of Prince William’s Rural Crescent, a land use policy that has preserved open space and natural resources in the
od
: County while reducing costs for new infrastructure. Kim also served on the Prince William County Planning
, Commission for more than a decade, representing the Occoquan District and advocating for smarter growth.
—e Ay ; : Kim was a passionate environmental educator and highly effective conservation advocate. She embodied the
Cent ; tag fay : best qualities in an advocate, with her persistence, creativity in identifying solutions and her ability to work
4 hie a with people of vastly different politics and persuasions. She was also a deeply compassionate person with a
commitment to teaching the next generation. She loved to conserve, protect and share the beauty of nature.
